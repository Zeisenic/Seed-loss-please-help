# Seed-loss-please-help
I wanted to update my transaction in my iota ligh wallet and exited wrongly. Now I have to enter my seed to login. However the problem is the pdf I saved from https://iotaseed.io/ is blanc because the print wallet button does not work.
What can I do I have now no seed and was only linked once to my wallet? please help
